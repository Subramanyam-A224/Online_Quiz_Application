Installation and Setup

**Prerequisites**:
*Java JDK 21*: Ensure Java is installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.
*Apache Tomcat*: Download and install Tomcat, and set it up in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
*MySQL Database*: Make sure MySQL is installed and running.

**Database Setup**:
Open MySQL and create a new database named quiz_app.

**Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables**:
*SQL*

CREATE DATABASE quiz_app;
USE quiz_app;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE questions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    question_text VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    option_a VARCHAR(100),
    option_b VARCHAR(100),
    option_c VARCHAR(100),
    option_d VARCHAR(100),
    correct_answer VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL
);
Populate the questions table with some sample quiz questions.

Configuring the Application
Clone or download this project to your local machine.
Place the servlet-api.jar in the lib/ directory.
Open the project in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
Update the database connection details in UserDao.java (inside src/com/quizapp/dao):
java
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quiz_app", "subramanyamavanapu", "yaswanth@2006");
Build and deploy the project on your Apache Tomcat server.
Usage
Register a new user on the /login.jsp page.
Log in using the registered credentials.
Take a quiz: After logging in, users are directed to a quiz page where they can select answers.
Submit the quiz: Once submitted, users receive their score.
Database Schema
The application uses a simple database schema with two main tables:

*users*: Stores user information (username, password).
*questions*: Stores quiz questions and answer options.

**Example of questions table structure**:

*id	question_text	option_a	option_b	option_c	option_d	correct_answer
1	What is the capital of USA?	New York	Washington	Los Angeles	Chicago	B*

**Future Improvements**
*Admin Panel*: Allow admin users to add/update/delete quiz questions.
*User Profile*s: Enhance user profiles to track quiz history and performance.
*Category-Based Quizzes*: Add quizzes based on categories (e.g., Science, History).
*Timer Functionality*: Add a timer for each quiz attempt.
